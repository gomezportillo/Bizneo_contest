Bizneo Contest
==

Bunch of improvised basic code developed for a small contest carried out by the university. Uploaded in the hope someone can find it useful.

First year it was a pretext to learn Ruby (actually the contest was aimed to do so)

Second year it was tried out to perform same operations but by means of python's requests library
